# Client Didnt Pay
Client isn't paying? This will make the website slowly rotate until they do.

## How to use?
### Requires Node.js
Download the Node.js Scripts found under `cdp/` and put the `cdp/` folder in the root folder of your website's source code (if you are using React.js or similar frameworks, put the `js` file it outputs in the `static/` folder)

Run `npm start` inside the `cdp/` folder.

Follow the steps the CLI gives you and you will get a HTML code snippet to put in all HTML files.

**Delete the `cdp/` folder after you built the HTML code**
